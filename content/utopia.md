## Starting with community and culture

> I've always to wanted to build a utopia. That seed was already planted before I even started primary school. Back then, I desired something that resembled a home, a place that soothes the harshness of the environment, a place where people understand and are understood. But I was never comfortable sharing that dream with anyone. So it remained a silent wish. So it remained an unsprouted seed in my head.

> After two decades, I grew a little wiser. I realized that utopias wouldn't occur naturally and that no amount of money could buy one either. Additionally, advances in technology and health care could enhance utopias but they could't create one either. If neither waiting nor making a bunch of money nor advancing technology and health care were essential, then what was? It's community and culture. Armed with that insight, I decided to pluck that seed from my head and plant it in a community. Let's see where this clumsy attempt goes.

It turns out forcing a community doesn't work. Not with my social skills at least. And even if it did work initially, burnout is a real concern especially when forcing things.

I did join a [Strong Towns group near me](https://www.strongtowns.org/local) and eventually found myself speaking in front of my city council. Why Strong Towns? I have a looming feeling that society is slowly decaying to chaos and instability. Strong Towns has some principles that can partially reverse this decay and put us on a path to sustainability.

## What do I want in the world

The following wants apply nearly universally.

Rights and responsibilities. There are no rights without responsibilities. Rights are privileges granted by fulfilling your responsibilities. I want everyone to know their rights **and** their responsibilities. Judging whether a responsibility or right is appropriate is something I need to think about later.

Governing education. I want everyone to learn how their governing bodies work. They should be able to interface with their governing bodies as early as possible. Examples should include current events and policies. The goal is to give people the confidence and knowledge to formulate and argue ideas that affect the policies they care about.
