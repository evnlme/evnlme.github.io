An idea dump with minimal or no explanation. Unsubstantiated drivel.

* Energy is fundamental.
* Systems that only consume are unsustainable. There is a problem if systems cannot produce.
* Maximize production, minimize consumption.
* Don't hesitate to administer local antibiotics. Systemic antibiotics are the ones to worry about.
* Learning to eat at maintenance is a prerequisite to bulking and cutting.
* Ideally, the money supply should match the value of the supply of our accumulated assets to keep prices relatively stable. Expanding the money supply too quickly (usually money printing) leads to inflation. That money simultaneously funds government programs and devalues the purchasing power of existing money. The inflation associated with money printing could be seen as a tax.
* The Achilles heel of cryptocurrencies is their costly energy consumption. If the average household paid their energy bills with crypto, a significant part of their bill would be in the cost of the transaction itself. Crypto is not appropriate for everyday transactions. I feel confident that crypto has a place in high-value transactions and is here to stay.
* Autoimmune and allergy symptoms decrease learning effectiveness. In some cases, learning may be stalled until symptoms are eliminated. Learning isn't limited to the academic sense. It includes learning motor skills, emotional skills, etc. Students without autoimmune and allergy symptoms have the advantage of learning more effectively, saving them both time and effort. I would love to see studies that test this.
* A great way to have no personal stories to tell is to hold the belief that "stories must be some grand, life changing epic". Oftentimes, I ended up in situations where ordinary stories are appropriate. However, that was challenging for me, because in accordance with the belief, I easily forgot my ordinary experiences. I didn't see the value in them. But I still wanted to tell compelling stories. Something needed to change, so I proposed a counter belief: "my ordinary experiences have value and they should be shared". While I can't do anything about the unborn stories of the past, I hope that by carrying the new belief forward, I'll have at least one story to tell.
* Names obscure. Names are noise. A facade for truth and understanding.
