An idea dump with minimal or no explanation. Unsubstantiated drivel.

* Energy is fundamental.
* Systems that only consume are unsustainable. There is a problem if systems cannot produce. * Maximize production, minimize consumption.
* Don't hesitate to administer local antibiotics. Systemic antibiotics are the ones to worry about.
* Learning to eat at maintenance is a prerequisite to bulking and cutting.
* Ideally, the money supply should match the value of the supply of our accumulated assets to keep prices relatively stable. Expanding the money supply too quickly (usually money printing) leads to inflation. That money simultaneously funds government programs and devalues the purchasing power of existing money. The inflation associated with money printing could be seen as a tax.
* The Achilles heel of cryptocurrencies is their costly energy consumption. If the average household paid their energy bills with crypto, a significant part of their bill would be in the cost of the transaction itself. Crypto is not appropriate for everyday transactions. I feel confident that crypto has a place in high-value transactions and is here to stay.
